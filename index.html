		We put the <script> tag at the bottom for 2 reasons:
			1.	When the browser hits a <script> tag it delays rendering the page, so for usability, the page will render faster if we put 
				the <script>s at the end.
			2.	If the Javascript is executed in the <head> the <body> won't be rendered yet so we won't be able to manipulate our html.
			
		When using php includes, any general <script>s should then be added to the footer include.
